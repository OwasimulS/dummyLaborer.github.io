        Hey, I'm Owasimul Sidick. I am 17 and attend Brooklyn Technical High
        School in NYC. I have two pet birds and a little sister. Utilizing the
        power of code, I helped create this website in hopes that people may get
        the help they need. After working at the local food pantry for a year or
        so, I have learned the need for a website that can help orders receive
        services or the help they need in their community. I hope to use this
        website in order to help bring communities closer and make sure the
        needs of the entire community can be met.

        Hello! I'm Tyler Rhodes-Wood, I'm 17 and attend Bayonne High School as a
        current rising senior in New Jersey. I love technology, videogames,
        sports, among other things. Thanks to All-Star Code, I've been able to
        deepen my pre-existing love for programming and technology with hopes of
        doing something professionally in its wide array of job offerings. Aside
        from this, I have a puppy and two younger brothers. I speak on behalf of
        my team when I say we are proud people have taken a liking to our site
        and will use it to further deepen community ties and spread the "helping
        hand" goal we set for this page. You can find me on<a

        Hello my name is Ariyan Abdin and I attend Townsend Harris highschool in
        New York. Some things I enjoy are gaming, reading, working out, and i've
        recently got a skateboard so i'm learning how to use that. I'm still
        confused as to which career path I want to choose so I came to All Star
        Code to dip my toes into the ocean of computer science. Creating this
        website has deepened my understanding of code and was an overall
        rewarding experience. I don't have a linked in as I just turned 15 but
